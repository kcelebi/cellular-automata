# Cellular-Automata

by Kaya Celebi

This set of programs creates and simulates scenarios of Cellular Automata, particularly the Game of Life.

##automata_brute.html

This program is a JavaScript file that runs the Game of Life scenario. It can be simply double-clicked to open in a browser.

##automata_brute.py

This program generates various Game of Life scenarios and stores them into .txt files. It subsequently runs a Processing file that displays the simulation. It effectively does the same thing as automata_brute.html, however, in a different medium.

The remaining files are helper files that allow me to run various tests and calculate potential file sizes.
